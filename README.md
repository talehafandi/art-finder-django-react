**PLEASE READ THIS FOR COMMIT BEST PRACTICES**

In Commit messages we should aim short and clear messages that will give idea to other developers about the purpose of this commit, what was done and what files/functions were altered. To do that, we will follow these guidelines
- Always mention commit type in the start and write your commit messages in present simple tense (e.g. "feat: add popup component" instead of "I added popup component")
- Make sure you are pushing to your own branch and pull changes before pushing.
- Even if you make mistake in commit message, do not try to change to undo commit. Just tell other members about the mistake.
- Avoid using rebase, revert, reset or any other dangerous git commands.
- Read about git commands and branches

Here are the commit types we are going to use:
feat – a new feature is introduced with the changes
fix – a bug fix has occurred
refactor – refactored code that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature (for example optimising function)
test – including new or correcting previous tests
docs – updates to documentation such as a the README or other markdown files
style – changes that do not affect the meaning of the code, likely related to code formatting such as white-space, missing semi-colons, and so on.
chore – changes that do not relate to a fix or feature and don't modify src or test files (for example updating dependencies)
